# Sawmill Machine Programming Toolkit (source README)
Howdy, hackers!

I work for a sawmill business. I made a toolkit which comes software packages. I
burned them on DVDs for someone who might come along in 10-20 years time(average
longevity of DVD+R DL medium). I wanted to share the software part of the
toolkit(which is actually the whole thing). I hope this project can crash course
anyone who wishes to hack this machine.

You'll find this project rather boring because all the good stuff is at the
sibiling project **CFS-100**(link below). This project only covers interfacing
with the machine for average IT guys.

Have fun!
